This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Goals of this Spike

Work on material ui styling and theme
make an upload button work

## This project currently does

It has a theme. The buttons in the theme are all gradient colored. It has an MUI upload button which brings up a file selection menu. Hopefully soon I'll be able to grab that file and send it to AWS S3

### `npm start`
